# Basics

- Motion Design is a discipline that uses animation and visual effects to bring static elements to life.
- Motion Design can be used in bunch of places like film title, user interfaces, avertisements and videos.
- When it comes to Web , we use Videos, Transitions and Animations to add motion to the interfaces.

- Videos can deliver information in a very dynamic and effective way because they're blend of visual, audio, motion and storytelling.

- Transitions are effects that gradually change the properties of an element from one state to another and they're best used for simple from-to movements.
- Transitions mimike the natural / real world movements.

- Animation are similar to transitions, but they allow for more complex and continuous motion.
