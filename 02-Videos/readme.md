# Web Motion Design - Videos

- Videos are the superheros of content delivery
- Loading videos from external sources is a breeze with simple embed codes, making it easy to add them to web pages.
- If we're self-hosting the videos, we can yse the `<video>` HTML element to add them anywhere on the page.
- We can fine tune the video functionality by usinh attributes like autoplay, muted, loop and controls.
- Controlling the apperance of the video player can be easily done by using libraries like VideoJS.
- We need to always optimize video format and size to ensure faster page loading times.
- In terms of video format, MP4 is an reliable option that is supported by all browsers and media players.
- WebM is also viable and while it's not as widely supported as MP4, it offers smaller file sizes without sacrificing quality.
- To compress a video or convert to a different format, we can use the free app Handbrake.
