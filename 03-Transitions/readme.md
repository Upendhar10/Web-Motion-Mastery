# CSS Transitions

- CSS Transitions are a functionality provided by the CSS hat enables smooth and gradual changes in element properties over a specified duration.
- They provide a way to add animations and visual effects to elements without using javascript or other libraries and frameworks.

- CSS Transitions are different than CSS Animations mainly because they go from point A to point B, with nothing in between.

- Applying transitions in CSS is done by using properties such as

```css
transition-property: ;
transition-duration: ;
transition-timing-function: ;
transition-delay: ;
```

- We can transition multiple element properties at the same time by separating them with commas.

- The browser can be instructed to transition all available properties at the same time by using the value 'all'. However, this should be avoided due to possible performance issues.
